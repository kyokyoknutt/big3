## DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS YET. IT'S UNFINISHED.
 

I'm planning on making a video detailing how to get started with Tinker's Construct, Thermal Dynamics, and Thaumcraft for noobies like me who don't know how to do anything.

 

This modpack is a compliment to that video, and includes those 3 mods along with a bunch of other tweaks to make them 1. work better together and 2. add new ways to do crap.

 

I'm also gonna be trying to see if I can add back in some of the in-game tutorialization Tinker's Construct had and maybe make an in-game quickstart guide to Thermal Dynamics. Not sure though.
